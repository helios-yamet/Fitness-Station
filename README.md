     # Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a modern, intuitive E-site for my local gym and encourage users to purchase the latest excercise plans and merchandise with one click. 
Potential users can range from 18 to elderly gym members, so an easy to use platform, that takes into account the full spectrum of technical ability amongst potential users is crucial to the success of the site. 

I decided to create the Fitness Station brand because I wanted to bring my own design and modern coding conventions to a local fitness facility, which is a cornerstone of the community but can greatly benefit from having E-site capabilities, such as being able to purchase their favourite fitness station brand t-shirt, exercise plan or protein; rather than having to physically visit the facility to make a purchase. 
Fitness station has a thriving exercise community, that I aim to capture, allowing users to share their completed workouts and the branded products they purchased from our site.

-  As a user I'd like to be able to search products anywhere on the site, this helps me find the product I am looking for quicker.

- As a user, after I have made a purchase I would like to leave review of the product I have bought, because I want to provide my opinion of a product.

#### Shopping Cart and Checkout

# Design

### There are three key sections that make up the design of the platform:

1.  Homepage, Products, profile page, and Order history

2. Registration& Login pages and verify, confirmation pages

3. Shopping Cart and Checkout pages


The website design is inspired by other e-sites such as Amazon and ebay, which introduce the site primarily through imagery, images of the products under special& latest offers headlines; which encourages the user to explore our products further. The reason for displaying offers on the homepage, this is to get the user to look at the products on sale and for them to buy those products, this increases the likelihood of products being sold. Also the home page has a special offer banner near the top, this allows for the gym owner to present special offers tailored for a particular week, month, or a specific season such as Christmas. 

On the homepage the user can explore the site using the search bar on the navigation, shop by category tabs just above the search bar, which takes user to the products and if they clicked the merchandise tab the page will show merchandise product only, same vice versa for workout plans. On the product page there are filters place at the top of the page below the navigation bar; which allows the user to sort through all the products until they find what they like.

### Typography

- The main fonts selected for this project are **Oxygen** and **Arsenal**. I think they are a well designed and easy to read google fonts and also represents the fitness station brand.

## Testing

Summary: *During the development of this project, I had the experience of facing some problems, exhaustively testing the functionality of each part of the platform and managed to solve most of the problems that arose before writing this document.*

*I received help from some family and friends to do the tests on the platform resources and all the problems presented were solved without problems for example my brother found that on his mobile device there was x-scroll on the create sprint page."*

__See testing documentation here: https://github.com/michodgs25/Sprint/blob/master/test.md__

## Version Control
This sites version control is through github linked to the heroku app, using gitpod IDE, once completed a piece of work, I would type into the terminal:

 #### git add -A
 - *Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.*
  
#### git commit -m "Update index.html code formatting" 
 - *Captures the state of a project at that point in time. Ensure message is specific to the changes made to the file(s).*
 
#### git push index.html
 - *This pushes the file to the github project repository.*
  
## Deployment


#### Requirements 
You will need the following tools installed on your system:

Python 3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/
An IDE such as Visual Studio, gitpod, Code, or like this project gitpod
An account at MongoDB Atlas - https:https://github.com/michodgs25/Sprint//www.mongodb.com/
Git - https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03


I personally used github on my local machine to develop the site using Python 3.7.3 and deployed to Heroku via Github.

1. To download or clone the site to your local machine you will need to go to my repo [here.](https://github.com/michodgs25/Sprint) and see deployment steps in https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository

2. Before you download or clone the site you will need to ensure you have Python 3.7 installed.

3. Once you have Python installed, created a virtual environment as appropriate to you chosen IDE and os.

4. Run the requirements.txt file as appropriate to your IDE to install the relevant required packages dependencies for the project into your virtual environment.

5. Run the app.py file as appropriate to your chosen environment and os.

6. You should now be able to view the site on your localhost on port 5000.


## Remote Deployment

#### Instructions
To deploy this app to Heroku you need to follow the steps below:

- Create a **requirements.txt** file so that Heroku can install all the dependencies required to run the app.
  `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

- Create a **Procfile** with the command:
  `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

- In this step, you have to create a free account on the [Heroku website](https://signup.heroku.com/).
-  Login to the account, click on new and then create a new app. In the following screen, you need to give a name and choose the Europe region.
-  In the menu access the **Deploy** option, after that click on Connect to Github. Just below provide the information from the app's repository on GitHub and select the option Enable Automatic Deploy.
- On the Dashboard of the APP, click on Settings and then click on the option **Reveal config Vars**.
- Now you need to add the following variables to **Reveal config Vars**:
  - **IP**: `0.0.0.0`
  - **PORT**: `5000`
  - **MONGO_URI**: `link to your Mongo DB`
  - **SECRET_KEY**: `your chosen secret key`
- You are now ready to access the deployed app on Heroku.
