     # Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a modern, intuitive E-site for my local gym and encourage users to purchase the latest excercise plans and merchandise with one click. 
Potential users can range from 18 to elderly gym members, so an easy to use platform, that takes into account the full spectrum of technical ability amongst potential users is crucial to the success of the site. 

I decided to create the Fitness Station brand because I wanted to bring my own design and modern coding conventions to a local fitness facility, which is a cornerstone of the community but can greatly benefit from having E-site capabilities, such as being able to purchase their favourite fitness station brand t-shirt and exercise plan or accessories; rather than having to physically visit the facility to make a purchase. 

Fitness station has a thriving exercise community, that I aim to capture, allowing users purchase& review product and contact the gym with any questions.

# Design

### There are three key sections that make up the design of the platform:

1.  Homepage, Products, profile page, Order history, review and contact pages

2. Registration& Login pages and verify, confirmation pages

3. Shopping Cart and Checkout pages


The website design is inspired by other e-sites such as Amazon and ebay, which introduce the site primarily through imagery, images of the product categories on the homepage to be exact; which encourages the user to explore our products immediately. The reason for this display on the homepage, is to get immediate user interaction with purchasing those products, which increases the likelihood of products being sold. The goal being to simplify users buying products and keeping that process simple is key.

On the homepage the user can explore the site using the search bar on the navigation, shop by category tabs just below the search bar, which takes user to the products and if they clicked the merchandise tab the page will show merchandise product only, same vice versa for workout plans. On the product page there are filters place at the top of the page below the navigation bar; which allows the user to sort through all the products until they find what they like.

See full article on design here __https://github.com/michodgs25/Fitness-Station/issues/1__

### Typography

- The main fonts selected for this project are **Oxygen** and **Arsenal**. I think they are a well designed and easy to read google fonts and also represents the fitness station brand.

-------
 
## Defensive design
Certain measure were taken to prevent users from making mistakes or malicious actions.

- General form validation
- Stripe has its own security system in place. I took nearly every part of code concerning stripe from the Boutique Ado project of the Code Institute.
- Several get_object_or_404 instances in the views.
- The checkout button is not available when the user is not logged on or does not have an account.
- The checkout view has @login_required tagged.(so no access when typing the url of the checkout page in the addressbar)
- As a measure to prevent users from putting to0 many products in the cart, the user is only able to have a maximum of 10 items of each product in the bag.

-------
 
### Schema Design

After careful consideration and taking into account all the different parts of the website and needs of the database, I designed the schema in five main models:

- Profiles: These are the details that the user saves to their profile for quick checkouts in the future. The username, email address and password details are set when the user registers for the site, and the delivery details are added when the user makes a purchase and selects to save those details to their profile.

- Orders: This includes the overall order in full, including the delivery details from (from or added to the user profile) and the order_line_items.
- order_line_items: This includes details of each product the user orders, the details of each product are linked to the products section.

products: This includes all the information related to each product, including the product item price, SKU, image, name, descriptions, category. Products can only be added by a Superuser/Authenticated user.

category: Linking to the category field in the products section, the Category model simply holds the categories which are chosen in the product model. These categories are pre-set and can only be modified or added to by a Superuser/Authenticated user.

Contact: This section is non-relational to the rest of the database, and it holds details of the blog posts including the blog title, author, status, image, image_url and the post itself. The blog can only be added by a Superuser/Authenticated user.

blog Comment: If a user is signed into their account and they wish to leave a comment on the blog, the email field required in the form will be linked to their account and pre-filled with the user’s email. The blog comment models also require a name, comment body, date it was created on and the active status (published or draft).

-------

## Testing

Summary: *During the development of this project, I had the experience of facing some problems, exhaustively testing the functionality of each part of the platform and managed to solve most of the problems that arose before writing this document.*

*I received help from some family and friends to do the tests on the platform resources and all the problems presented were solved without problems for example my brother found that on his mobile device there was x-scroll on the create sprint page."*

__See testing documentation here: https://github.com/michodgs25/Sprint/blob/master/test.md__

## Version Control
This sites version control is through github linked to the heroku app, using gitpod IDE, once completed a piece of work, I would type into the terminal:

 #### git add -A
 - *Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.*
  
#### git commit -m "Update index.html code formatting" 
 - *Captures the state of a project at that point in time. Ensure message is specific to the changes made to the file(s).*
 
#### git push index.html
 - *This pushes the file to the github project repository.*
  

## Deployment

#### Requirements 
You will need the following tools& accounts installed on your system and an account with:

Python 3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/

An IDE such as Visual Studio, gitpod, Code, or like this project gitpod

An account at Heroku - https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps

An account with AWS(Amazon web services) - https://aws.amazon.com/console/

I personally used github on my local machine to develop the site using Python 3.7.3 and deployed to Heroku via Github.

1. To download or clone the site to your local machine you will need to go to my repo [here.](https://github.com/michodgs25/fitness-station-360) and see deployment steps in https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository

2. Before you download or clone the site you will need to ensure you have Python 3.7 installed.

3. Once you have Python installed, created a virtual environment as appropriate to you chosen IDE and os.

4. Run the requirements.txt file as appropriate to your IDE to install the relevant required packages dependencies for the project into your virtual environment.

5. Run the app.py file as appropriate to your chosen environment and os.

6. You should now be able to view the site on your localhost on port 8000.


### Deployment: Heroku

I decided to deploy the project to Heroku so I could see, test
and update the site in real-time. Here is my deployment process.

See full deployment process here: __https://github.com/michodgs25/Fitness-Station-360/issues/7#issue-772489110__

----------

## Travis continuous integration 

Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments. This is where Travis CI comes in.

As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports the development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other parts of the development process by managing deployments and notifications.

#### Instructios on how to integrate Travis CI:
*See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/ for full documentation*

- To start using Travis CI, make sure you have:

* A GitHub or Bitbucket or GitLab.

* Owner permission for a project hosted on the above platforms.
