     # Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a modern, intuitive E-site for my local gym and encourage users to purchase the latest excercise plans and merchandise with one click. 
Potential users can range from 18 to elderly gym members, so an easy to use platform, that takes into account the full spectrum of technical ability amongst potential users is crucial to the success of the site. 

I decided to create the Fitness Station brand because I wanted to bring my own design and modern coding conventions to a local fitness facility, which is a cornerstone of the community but can greatly benefit from having E-site capabilities, such as being able to purchase their favourite fitness station brand t-shirt and exercise plan or accessories; rather than having to physically visit the facility to make a purchase. 

Fitness station has a thriving exercise community, that I aim to capture, allowing users purchase& review product and contact the gym with any questions.

# UX

## UI 

Using the five planes of UX model created by Jesse Garrett, below describes the project from concept to surface level:

- 1 __Strategy Level__



- 2 __Feature Level__



- 3 __Structure Level__
 


- 4 __Layout Level__



- 5 __Surface Level__

  
 See article below I describe the process of creating the platform each plane phase; from stratedgy to surface level:

# Design

### There are three key sections that make up the design of the platform:

1.  Homepage, Products, profile page, Order history, review and contact pages

2. Registration& Login pages and verify, confirmation pages

3. Shopping Cart and Checkout pages


The website design is inspired by other e-sites such as Amazon and ebay, which introduce the site primarily through imagery, images of the product categories on the homepage to be exact; which encourages the user to explore our products immediately. The reason for this display on the homepage, is to get immediate user interaction with purchasing those products, which increases the likelihood of products being sold. The goal being to simplify users buying products and keeping that process simple is key.

On the homepage the user can explore the site using the search bar on the navigation, shop by category tabs just below the search bar, which takes user to the products and if they clicked the merchandise tab the page will show merchandise product only, same vice versa for workout plans. On the product page there are filters place at the top of the page below the navigation bar; which allows the user to sort through all the products until they find what they like.

### Typography

- The main fonts selected for this project are **Oxygen** and **Arsenal**. I think they are a well designed and easy to read google fonts and also represents the fitness station brand.

## Testing

Summary: *During the development of this project, I had the experience of facing some problems, exhaustively testing the functionality of each part of the platform and managed to solve most of the problems that arose before writing this document.*

*I received help from some family and friends to do the tests on the platform resources and all the problems presented were solved without problems for example my brother found that on his mobile device there was x-scroll on the create sprint page."*

__See testing documentation here: https://github.com/michodgs25/Sprint/blob/master/test.md__

## Version Control
This sites version control is through github linked to the heroku app, using gitpod IDE, once completed a piece of work, I would type into the terminal:

 #### git add -A
 - *Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.*
  
#### git commit -m "Update index.html code formatting" 
 - *Captures the state of a project at that point in time. Ensure message is specific to the changes made to the file(s).*
 
#### git push index.html
 - *This pushes the file to the github project repository.*
  
## Deployment


#### Requirements 
You will need the following tools installed on your system:

Python 3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/
An IDE such as Visual Studio, gitpod, Code, or like this project gitpod
An account at MongoDB Atlas - https:https://github.com/michodgs25/Sprint//www.mongodb.com/
Git - https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03


I personally used github on my local machine to develop the site using Python 3.7.3 and deployed to Heroku via Github.

1. To download or clone the site to your local machine you will need to go to my repo [here.](https://github.com/michodgs25/Sprint) and see deployment steps in https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository

2. Before you download or clone the site you will need to ensure you have Python 3.7 installed.

3. Once you have Python installed, created a virtual environment as appropriate to you chosen IDE and os.

4. Run the requirements.txt file as appropriate to your IDE to install the relevant required packages dependencies for the project into your virtual environment.

5. Run the app.py file as appropriate to your chosen environment and os.

6. You should now be able to view the site on your localhost on port 8000.


## Remote Deployment
Deployment: Heroku

I decided to deploy the project to Heroku so I could see, test
and update the site in real-time. Here is my deployment process.

__Phase one__

1. Open up https://dashboard.heroku.com/ and logged into my account
2. Create a new app: fitness station, selecting the location nearest me (Europe)
3. Under the ‘Resources’ tab, search for and add on the ‘Heroku Postgress DB’ app
4. In the project terminal, install ‘dj_database_url’ & ‘psycopg2’ by using the following
commands:
a. pip3 install dj_database_url
b. pip3 install psycopg2-binary

5. Next, I froze the requirements(pip3 freeze > requirments.txt) to ’requirements.txt’ to make sure Heroku installs all our
apps’ requirements when we deploy the project.

6. In settings.py at the top, import the DJ database: ‘import dj_database_url’

7. Comment out the current ‘DATABASE’ settings (we will need them later), and add:
- a. ‘default’: dj_database_url.parse(insert database URL)
- b. Add the Database URL into the () which you can find in the Heroku app under
Settings – Reveal Config Vars - DATABASE_URL

8. Now we need to run all the migrations to get our database set up:
a. python3 manage.py migrate

9. Next, create a superuser using the command: python3 manage.py createsuperuser. 

10. Now back in settings.py, remove the new database settings and uncomment out the original
settings. This stops the database URL going into version control.

11. Update the Database settings in settings.py with an if statement, so that when we are
running the app on Heroku it will connect to the database URL, otherwise we connect to site
to Sequel light.

__Phase Two__

1. Now to install gunicorn which will act as our webserver:
a. pip3 install gunicorn

2. Freeze it to our requirements.TXT file as before

3. Create Procfile to tell Heroku to create a web dynamo, which will run unicorn and serve our
Django app:

4. Add this line of text to the Procfile: web: gunicorn fitness-station.wsgi:application

5. Log into Heroku via the terminal with the command: heroku login -i

6. Temporarily disable collect static using the following command: heroku config:set
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 –app fitness-station (--app fitness-station must be added as I
have more than 1 app in Heroku)

7. In settings.py, update the ‘ALLOWED_HOSTS settings. ‘Localhost’ allows GitPod to still work
too.
a. ALLOWED_HOSTS = [magnetic-eyes.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']

8. Finally, for this step, copy all the environment variables for the project from Gitpod settings
to Heroku – Settings - Config Vars.


## Travis continuous integration 

Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments. This is where Travis CI comes in.

As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports the development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other parts of the development process by managing deployments and notifications.

#### Instructios on how to integrate Travis CI:
*See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/ for full documentation*

- To start using Travis CI, make sure you have:

* A GitHub or Bitbucket or GitLab.

* Owner permission for a project hosted on the above platforms.
