     # Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a modern, intuitive E-site for my local gym and encourage users to purchase the latest excercise plans and merchandise with one click. 
Potential users can range from 18 to elderly gym members, so an easy to use platform, that takes into account the full spectrum of technical ability amongst potential users is crucial to the success of the site. 

I decided to create the Fitness Station brand because I wanted to bring my own design and modern coding conventions to a local fitness facility, which is a cornerstone of the community but can greatly benefit from having E-site capabilities, such as being able to purchase their favourite fitness station brand t-shirt and exercise plan or accessories; rather than having to physically visit the facility to make a purchase. 

Fitness station has a thriving exercise community, that I aim to capture, allowing users purchase& review product and contact the gym with any questions.

# Design

### There are three key sections that make up the design of the platform:

1.  Homepage, Products, profile page, Order history, review and contact pages

2. Registration& Login pages and verify, confirmation pages

3. Shopping Cart and Checkout pages


The website design is inspired by other e-sites such as Amazon and ebay, which introduce the site primarily through imagery, images of the product categories on the homepage to be exact; which encourages the user to explore our products immediately. The reason for this display on the homepage, is to get immediate user interaction time, which increases the likelihood of products being purchased. A goal of the platform is to simplify the process of purchasing products.

On the homepage the user can explore the site using the search bar on the navigation, below the search bar, are three separate products dropdown tabs aligned horizontally:
- All products
- workout plans
- activewear& accessories

Which when the user clicks each tab displays a range of product options the user can choose to filter available products. 

See full article on design here __https://github.com/michodgs25/Fitness-Station/issues/1__

### Typography

- The main fonts selected for this project are **Oxygen** and **Arsenal**. I think they are a well designed and easy to read google fonts and also represents the fitness station brand.

*https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arsenal?sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Arsenal:wght@700|Oxygen:wght@300*

------

### Colours

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/michodgs25/Fitness-Station-360/blob/master/media/readme/platform-colors.png" 
     target="_blank" rel="noopener" alt="Platform colors">
</div>

-  Bootstrap fonts& colors are are used throughout the site:

.text-success - Used for buttons to view products, secure checkout and view product reviews.

.text-danger - Used as login button if use does not have an account or needs to login before completing checkout and login 'forgot password' text.

.text-warning - used as product card body, contact page, review page backgrounds.


The purpose for implementing these bootstrap styles are two-fold:

1. Mimic the traffic light system, danger being danger(stop/alert), warning(information/wait) and success(go). 
2. Practical, allows for quicker development time without compromising UX.

See bootstrap documentation for full range of colors - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/colors/

* *The product images are displayed horizontally in fours for desktop& tablet and stacked vertically on mobile screens.*

* *Each product image, details, rating, price and review button is stored in a bootstrap card. The image in the header and the rest in the card footer.*

* *The user can click on the review button, which takes the user to the review product page where the user can create a review of the product or just look at previous reviews posted.*

* *If user clicks on image, it will take the user to the product detail page, where the user can add the product to their bag, or just keep shopping. The user can select their product size(if applicable). Once product is added, the user will be notified via a notification.*

* *At the foot of the page is the platform footer which displays all products and contact page in bootstrap cards format.*

* *On any of the products pages, there is a scroll to top button to the far right of the page, which takes the user back to top of the page.*

--------

### Bag page

* *The bag page displays all the products the user has added.*

* *The product image, name, quantity and product cost is displayed in table format.*

* *User can toggle each product quantity or remove the product from the bag entirely, toggler is located in the 'qty' section.*

* *Below the table, bottom right; the grand-total of the bag is displayed.*

* *Below the grand total are two buttons: a keep shopping button and either a secure checkout if user is logged in or a login button if the user is not signed/does not have an account.*

* *At the foot of the page is the platform footer which displays all products and contact page in bootstrap cards format.*

   
### Checkout and Checkout Success

* *Checkout page is only available if user has an account with the platform.*

* *Checkout page is divided into two primary sections, left hand side is the checkout form, which the user is required to input personal and billing/shipping details. The right hand side of the page hold the order summary, number of items, product names, size if applicable(otherwise n/a), subtotal, then below delivery cost if item subtotal does not pass free delivery threshold($50) delivery costing $3, and grand total of the bag.*

* *User once completed all checkout form details can tick a box after country select field, to save details to their profile.*

* *At the bottom of the checkout form, are two buttons 'adjust bag' and 'complete checkout', adjust bag transports user back to bag page and complete order processes order but only if the checkout form is valid. If the form is valid and is submitted, the platform processes the payment, redirect user to the checkout success page.*

* *Once order has been processed, the user is redirected to checkout success page which contains the order details and is notified a confirmation is sent to the email the user provided.*

* *Order detail example:*

* *At the bottom of the order is a button with the caption "Now checkout our other products", which transports the user to the all products page.*
   
--------

## User Profile

* *User profile is created automatically when user register their account with the platform.*

* *The profile has a default delivery information which is blank until the user either completes an order and ticks the save delivery information box addING the details to the profile, or user adds the details manually upon completing registration. User can update these details, at any point and details are automatically filled when user secures checkout.*

## Features left to be implemented


Summary:


----------

### Issues and bugs
*This section looks into what existing issues that are still present in the project& what future iterations could do to resolve these issues:*


-------
 
## Defensive design
Certain measure were taken to prevent users from making mistakes or malicious actions.

- General form validation
- Stripe has its own security system in place. I took nearly every part of code concerning stripe from the Boutique Ado project of the Code Institute.
- Several get_object_or_404 instances in the views.
- The checkout button is not available when the user is not logged on or does not have an account.
- The checkout view has @login_required tagged.(so no access when typing the url of the checkout page in the addressbar)
- As a measure to prevent users from putting to0 many products in the cart, the user is only able to have a maximum of 10 items of each product in the bag.

-------
 
### Schema Design

After careful consideration and taking into account all the different parts of the website and needs of the database, I designed the schema in six main models:

1. 
Profiles: These are the details that the user saves to their profile for quick checkouts in the future. The username, email address and password details are set when the user registers for the site, and the delivery details are added when the user makes a purchase and selects to save those details to their profile.


2.
Orders: This includes the overall order in full, including the delivery details from (from or added to the user profile) and the order_line_items.
- order_line_items: This includes details of each product the user orders, the details of each product are linked to the products section.

3. 
products: This includes all the information related to each product, including the product item price, SKU, image, name, descriptions, category. Products can only be added by a Superuser/Authenticated user.

category: Linking to the category field in the products section, the Category model simply holds the categories which are chosen in the product model. These categories are pre-set and can only be modified or added to by a Superuser/Authenticated user.

4. 
Checkout:
This section takes in the user personal, billing and card details. User does have the option save the billing details near to their profile

5. 
Contact: This section is non-relational to the rest of the database, and it holds details of the blog posts including the blog title, author, status, image, image_url and the post itself. The blog can only be added by a Superuser/Authenticated user.

6.
Review post: If a user is signed into their account and they wish to leave a review on a particular product, they can do so by clicking the review button on the desired product card in the products page, however this section is also non-relational to the rest of the database, this allows for creative freedom and allows users to retain anonymity. The review post models also require a name, review text amd date it was created on.

-------

## Testing

Summary: *During the development of this project, I experience some minor issues, exhaustively testing the functionality of each part of the platform and managed to solve most of the problems that arose before writing this document.*

*I received help from some family and friends to do the tests on the platform resources and all the problems presented were solved without problems for example my brother found that on his mobile device there was x-scroll on the create sprint page."*

__See testing documentation here: https://github.com/michodgs25/Sprint/blob/master/test.md__

## Version Control
This sites version control is through github linked to the heroku app, using gitpod IDE, once completed a piece of work, I would type into the terminal:

 #### git add -A
 - *Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.*
  
#### git commit -m "Update index.html code formatting" 
 - *Captures the state of a project at that point in time. Ensure message is specific to the changes made to the file(s).*
 
#### git push index.html
 - *This pushes the file to the github project repository.*
 
#### Git Branches - 
 
Requirements may be different for other sevices, for this project I used Git.
 
 To implement my review& contact us features I created new branches in my github repository.
 
 Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to
 encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before
 merging it into the main branch. - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches
 
 Using the atlassian git using branches tutorial guide - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches: 
 
 Create new Branch and move into newly created branch - 
 
 type into your terminal: git checkout -b *new-branch-name* 
 
 *Warning* -  
 my review branch for this project is called new_branch, due to the first time I have implemented branches. 
 My contact page branch is aptly named: contact_branch, I advise all developers to provide a branch name that represents the purpose of the branch, this keeps things clear for
 other developers who may view your project. 
 
------
  

## Deployment

#### Requirements 
You will need the following tools& accounts installed on your system and an account with:

Python 3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/

An IDE such as Visual Studio, gitpod, Code, or like this project gitpod

An account at Heroku - https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps

An account with AWS(Amazon web services) - https://aws.amazon.com/console/

I personally used github on my local machine to develop the site using Python 3.7.3 and deployed to Heroku via Github.

1. To download or clone the site to your local machine you will need to go to my repo [here.](https://github.com/michodgs25/fitness-station-360) and see deployment steps in https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository

2. Before you download or clone the site you will need to ensure you have Python 3.7 installed.

3. Once you have Python installed, created a virtual environment as appropriate to you chosen IDE and os.

4. Run the requirements.txt file as appropriate to your IDE to install the relevant required packages dependencies for the project into your virtual environment.

5. Run the app.py file as appropriate to your chosen environment and os.

6. You should now be able to view the site on your localhost on port 8000.


### Deployment: Heroku

I decided to deploy the project to Heroku so I could see, test
and update the site in real-time. Here is my deployment process.

See full deployment process here: *https://github.com/michodgs25/Fitness-Station-360/issues/7#issue-772489110*

----------

## Travis continuous integration 

Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments. This is where Travis CI comes in.

As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports the development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other parts of the development process by managing deployments and notifications.

#### Instructios on how to integrate Travis CI:
*See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/ for full documentation*

- To start using Travis CI, make sure you have:

* A GitHub or Bitbucket or GitLab.

* Owner permission for a project hosted on the above platforms.

For this project I used github and followed these steps:

1. Go to Travis-ci.com and Sign up with GitHub.

2. Accept the Authorization of Travis CI. You’ll be redirected to GitHub. For any doubts on the Travis CI GitHub Authorized OAuth App access rights message, please read more details below

3. Click on your profile picture in the top right of your Travis Dashboard, click Settings and then the green Activate button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.

For more details see full documentation *https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/*
