     # Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a modern, intuitive E-site for my local gym and encourage users to purchase the latest excercise plans and merchandise with one click. 
Potential users can range from 18 to elderly gym members, so an easy to use platform, that takes into account the full spectrum of technical ability amongst potential users is crucial to the success of the site. 

I decided to create the Fitness Station brand because I wanted to bring my own design and modern coding conventions to a local fitness facility, which is a cornerstone of the community but can greatly benefit from having E-site capabilities, such as being able to purchase their favourite fitness station brand t-shirt, exercise plan or protein; rather than having to physically visit the facility to make a purchase. 
Fitness station has a thriving exercise community, that I aim to capture, allowing users to share their completed workouts and the branded products they purchased from our site.

# Design

### There are three key sections that make up the design of the platform:

1.  Homepage, Products, profile page, and Order history

2. Registration& Login pages and verify, confirmation pages

3. Shopping Cart and Checkout pages


The website design is inspired by other e-sites such as Amazon and ebay, which introduce the site primarily through imagery, images of the products under special& latest offers headlines; which encourages the user to explore our products further. The reason for displaying offers on the homepage, this is to get the user to look at the products on sale and for them to buy those products, this increases the likelihood of products being sold. Also the home page has a special offer banner near the top, this allows for the gym owner to present special offers tailored for a particular week, month, or a specific season such as Christmas. 

On the homepage the user can explore the site using the search bar on the navigation, shop by category tabs just above the search bar, which takes user to the products and if they clicked the merchandise tab the page will show merchandise product only, same vice versa for workout plans. On the product page there are filters place at the top of the page below the navigation bar; which allows the user to sort through all the products until they find what they like.
